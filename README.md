* SHORT CODES 1

 * This Class contains fib, factorial and String analyzing methods using recursion with memoization and direct approach.

	 * Recursion with memoization
	 * Efficient as for loop. 
	 * If it is called several times, better than for loop because it stores data.
	 * Requires a lot of MEMORY for big numbers.

     * This method is checking if two strings are twins.
     * Two Strings are twins if they contain the same characters, not necessarily in the same order.

     * Wrapper method for checking if two strings are twins.
     * Two Strings are twins if they contain the same characters, not necessarily in the same order.
     * Recursive approach
     * Makes StringBuilder objects and passes them to other method.
     * In recursive approach, wrapper method is the best solution because we do not want to create a lot
     * of Strings, due to theirs immutability and we do not want to create new StringBuilders again and
     * again for each step of recursion.

     * Wrapper method for checking if number and orientation of parentheses
     * in passed math expression is correct.
     * Wrapper method strips everything except parentheses and forwards them as a char array.
 
     * Method for checking if number and orientation of parentheses is correct.

* SHORT CODES 2

 * This Class contains methods for List, 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays manipulation using J7 and J8 methods.

     * Prints reversed String if present (Optional.ifPresent())

     * Returns reversed String

     * Flattens matrix so you can find min, max, count

     * Flattens cube so you can find min, max, count
 
     * Prints all the elements of 2D array
 
     * Prints all the elements of 3D array
 
     * Returns String representing all the elements of 3D array separated with ",". No "," after last element.
 
     * Generates random List<Integer>

     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the list

     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the list using Streams

     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the 2D array

     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the 2D array using Streams
 
     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the 3D array

     * Returns number of repetitions of the searched element of the 3D array using Streams

     * Returns the most common element in the List and number of its repetitions

     * Returns the most common element in the List and number of its repetitions

     * Finds an index of the searched element of the List

     * Finds an index of the searched element of the List
